# Messing around with csszengarden

I found this resource and thought I may eventually try my hand at this :)

The rules are embedded in the HTML page and the source, but basically:

 - only edit the styles.css
 - try to only use CSS 1 and CSS 2 to ensure the elements work everywhere.

One of my motivations is that I _roughly_ know css, but I don't know enough to
be anywhere near proficient. I saw [this tweet from Julia
Evans](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1288848994995712005?s=20) that was
asking if people would expect the CSS on their site to continue working for the
next ten years and there were a lot of responses that, yes, indeed, css should
work for a long time after its written if there are no weird hacks.
